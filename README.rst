An oemof extension to use the oemof related postgis database.

To use this extension you have to have access to the oemof postgis database.

The oemof code will be released in early 2016 but you can try this extension
already with the feedinlib. If you are interested to join the oemof database
project please contact us.

Configuration
+++++++++++++

As the purpose of this package is to facilitate usage of the ``oemof``
database, it needs to know how to connect to this database. Being part of
``oemof``, ``oemof_pg`` looks for this configuration in the file ``config.ini``
in a directory called ``.oemof`` in your home directory.

To configure database access this file has to have a section ``[postGIS]``
section containing the necessary options, like this:

  .. code:: INI
    :title: config.ini

    [postGIS]
    username = username under which to connect to the database
    database = name of the database from which to read
    host     = host to connect to
    port     = port to connect to
    pw       = password used to connect with the given username (OPTIONAL)

The password is optional. If you don't want to store the password in the
``config.ini``, you may store it using the `keyring package`_, which is a
dependency of ``oemof_pg``, like this:

  .. code:: python

    >>> import keyring
    >>> keyring.set_password("database", "username")

where ``"database"`` and ``"username"`` have the same values as the
corresponding options in ``config.ini``.
